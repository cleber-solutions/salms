# To do list

## Keybindings

* Press `c' to center on selected cell.
* Press `Space` to enable manual beats.
* Press `Return` to trigger action on selected cell.
* Use arrow keys to navigate throuhg the grid.
* Press `Escape` to clean up everything and start again.

## Components

* Implement "teleporters", so one component can interact
  with another that is not it's neighbour.

## Flow control

* Implement a *event log*, so that in the future we are
  able to go **back** and forward on time.

## Commodities

* Ability to **create GIFs**, so that I don't need to
  rely on Peek anymore. :-)
